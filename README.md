# What are Retrospectives?

They say hindsight is 20/20.

If you've spent time on an "agile" software project, you've likely encountered the notion of a "retrospective."  It's a designated time at the end of each sprint for the team to take a breather, reflect on the work that's been done (or not done), and as a team, identify how to improve the next sprint.

Baked deep into the brain of every Agile team member is the notion of *continual improvement*.  I've found that "Agile" isn't really about delivering a perfect product. All it can really do is perfect a process.  It's about finding ways to improve software outcomes in small steps, and to do that on a rolling basis.  The *sprint* becomes the team's official unit of time, and are expected to deliver improved software with each tick of the clock.

Agile teams have a menu of choices when it comes to sprint activities.  In addition to coding, teams can incorporate daily stand-ups, estimation meetings, prioritization, release planning, and team retrospectives.  These activites are supposed to be the I-beams that support the team's communication and process flow.

Retrospectives aren't just for teams.  I'd like to share about my experience of using the retrospective approach in two other contexts: classrooms and personal career growth.




# For Agile Development Teams

Some teams do them religiously, but still don't improve from one sprint to the next.  Others begin a project with enthusiasm for retrospectives, but give them up soon after.  In the hustle and bustle of a software project, where team members are already loaded to the max with a thousand chores and responsibilities, retrospectives can lose out to "higher priority" activities.

However, I believe dropping the retrospective is actually second-worst thing an agile team can do (the first would be dropping the daily stand).  If agile is all about continuous improvement, removing the team retrospective almost guarantees the team won't improve at all.

The value gained from a 30-minute conversation twice a month far outweighs the perceived cost.

I think teams that don't do retrospectives have lost sight of their value.  Perhaps, rather than using retros as a safe place for the team to come together and come up with honest solutions to real problems, they became a routine drubbing by the iteration manager, and it's an hour of "what went wrong and who should we blame."  Retrospectives should be enjoyable and insightful. A time for the team to kick back and reflect, be transparent, and make observations.

So let's get back to the basics and use plain empiricism. If you've had bad luck running retrospectives on your team, or never tried them before, he's a technique that I think will get you off to a good start: the four-quadrant poster.  Here's what it looks like:

![Team Board](https://raw.github.com/JeffCohen/retro-article/master/team-board.png)

It's a simple process.  Start with food.  Everybody likes food.  Get this poster up on a wall or projected onto the screen.  Everybody takes turns shouting out one-sentence retrospective items that fall into one of these four categories.

* **Start**: Something that you think the team should start doing.
* **Stop**: Something that you think the team should stop doing.
* **Continue**: Something that you think the team should keep doing.
* **Aha**: An insight gained from the previous sprint, no matter how small or how large.

Here are some examples:

|Quadrant|Example|
|---|---|
|START|Get a CI server up and running. End meetings on time. Use better commit messages.|
|STOP|Long daily stands. Being blocked while waiting for marketing copy (use placeholder text and move on). |
|CONTINUE|Pair-programing sessions have been great.  End-of-day status updates on the whiteboard are helpful.|
|AHA|Marketing is on a different schedule than us.  Github repositories can integrate with our issue tracker via webhooks.  There's a new coffee machine on our floor. |

The idea isn't to come up with as many items as possible.  That leads to people reaching for something to say things that aren't imporant.  Most of the time, there will be one or two items from each category that provide real eye-opening value.  Therefore, I believe it's best o time-box your retrospective sessions to 30 minutes.  Don't let the team devolve into a problem-solving session.  If there's an item that seems to warrant its own discussion, ask the team if it's worth a separate meeting for that item.  Usually, the threat of another meeting motivates the team to find common ground quickly.  


# For Career Growth

The value of the retrospective can be so powerful that it's worth exploring how it can go beyond the classical agile team setting.  I'd like to spend the rest of our time describing two ways in which I have extrapolated it into two other meaningful scenerios: for personal career growth, and in the classroom.

Do you feel like your career isn't headed in the direction you would like?  Perhaps you're going down the right road, but you wish you could press the accelerator a bit more?  One of the easiest things you can do to change your career direction and your speed is to do a career retrospective.  I do this for myself once a year, at the same time every year, whether I'm thrilled with my job or not.  You might find that every six months is a better cadence, but every month too much.  Steering a career is like steering an aircraft carrier.  You can't expect to do a U-turn on a dime.  Think ahead, and begin course-corrections early.  Then, have patience.  The good news is that even a small turn in direction will, over time, result in a large change in your ultimate destination.

This kind of retro is very different from the team retros.  It's mostly feeling-based.  It's subjective, not objective.  The goal is to try to sum up your current level of satisfaction in a way that can both bring meaningful change as well as remind you of the good things that you might be taking for granted.  

Every time I do a personal retrospective, I consider these things about my current job:

* Inputs: Am I being required to use my full brain in a challenging fashion? Or am I just doing the same things over and over?  Am I working with colleagues that I can learn from?
* Outputs: Am I getting the results I want?  Do I like explaining the effects of my job to my friends and family?  Am I helping others?  Am I gradually becoming an authority in at least one area?  Does my compensation reflect the value I bring to the company?

I find it also to graph my feelings, and compare graphs from one year to the next.  Here are some example data points I use, graphed on a scale of 1-10 for each:

* Mission: to what extent are you excited about the company mission?
* My Role: to what extent do I like my role withing the organization?
* Compensation: is my compensation at a fair amount?
* Physical environment: is the workplace conducive to work?  Do I enjoy coming into the office? 
* Culture: do I feel the culture around me is healthy?  Are risks encouraged?  Are individuals wrongly blamed when something goes wrong?  Is there too much politics instead of honest communication?  Are people enjoying themselves and their coworkers?

Plot each of these and connect the dots into a curve.  I think you'll find it a great way to describe how you feel about your current situation.

But perhaps best of all, your retro curve will act as spotlight, pinpointing the areas you can choose to focus on for positive change.  Ask yourself what it would take to move every data point up to a 10.  Showing your retrospective graph to your boss can be a great way to get an open dialogue started.



# In Educational Settings


Finally I'd like to describe how to use a retrospective in a classroom setting.  As Chief Instructor of The Starter League in Chicago, I've taught 17 distinct sections of our beginner-focused Web Development course for non-programmers.  At the beginning, I knew I wanted to incorporate the concept of retrospectives into the classroom but I wasn't sure how.  I tried many different formats and experiments over that time, converging on a simple technique that I think every teacher can put into practice.  I call it the Aha/Fuzzy board, and it looks like this:

[PIC OF AHA BOARD HERE]

Here's the process I use:

At the end of each week, I put up the Aha/Fuzzy Board, and for five minutes students shout items that should go on the board.  An "Aha!" is one thing that a student learned that week.  One light-bulb.  A moment of clarity, no matter how small.  In my class, it might be "I know how to put a border around an image!" or "I finally understood how to use the .each method" or "A hyperlink isn't a magical thing to me anymore."  I encourage students to jot these aha moments down throughout the week so they can be ready for our Friday sessions.

A "Fuzzy" item is anything we've covered that's still, well, fuzzy.  Examples are "I still don't get what a class method is" or "CSS floats never work right for me."

After about five minutes, I have a goldmine of information.  Actually I have *two* goldmines: one for the students, and one for me!

For the students, the mere act of identifying ahas and fuzzies forces them to reflect on their learning.  It's very easy for students to take for granted what they've learned, but it's so empowering when we can call them out by name.  Often when we start the retro process, there's silence - no one can think of any Aha moments.  Then one student will break the ice, then another, and pretty soon it's an avalance.  Hearing other students put a name to the things they've learned is so very helpful to all the other students.  It jogs their memory, and reminds them that even though they might presently be stuck on a problem, they shouldn't forget all the great things they've accomplished so far.  And when they identify Fuzzy items, they've instantly put their finger on what they should be learning next.  Students struggle when they're not sure where they stand.  They can be unsure of where to spend their time.  With the Aha/Fuzzy board, it's becomes immediately clear what they need to go back and study, and what they don't.

As the instructor, the Aha/Fuzzy board provides feedback on how I'm doing as a teacher.  I can quickly find out which of my lessons acheived their goals, and which did not.  Ahas point to lessons that were crafted well; fuzzies tell me which topics I might want to spiral on next week.  The board gives me food for thought on how to plan the next week.

# Moving Forward

We think that retrospectives are about looking back, but in fact they're all about moving forward.  It's like getting Lasik for your team, career, or classroom.  They will enable you to clearly see how to change, how to adapt, and how to move forward.  

These three retrospective boards are just the ones that I use.  I'd love to hear how you use retrospectives.  Or perhaps you'd like some help getting started for the first time.  Either way I'd love to hear about it.  Find me on twitter, @jeffcohen, or email me at jeff@starterleague.com.
