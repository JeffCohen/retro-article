# Pools of Reflection

As developers and managers, most of us are always on the go.  We're focused on the next project, the next deadline, the next client.  Always looking forward.

Is it ever worthwhile to look back?

I think it is.  You've heard it said that "hindsight is 20/20."  The infamous "learn from your mistakes."  And of course, "if you don't know your history, you're doomed to repeat it."

But if you're like me, these phrases remain solidly in the realm of theory and clich√©.  Let's face it, it's not always fun to look back.  So we prefer to simply focus on the here and now, believing we will somehow do better next time.

We disregard the value of looking back because we think that's all it is: looking back.
Hindsight is indeed 20/20, but it also sharpens our picture of the future. If you want to improve something - whether it's your product, your team's performance, or you career - you have to look back in order to see ahead.

### What is a Retrospective?

Baked deep into the brain of every Agile team member is the notion of continual improvement.  Agile isn't really about delivering a perfect product as much as delivering a perfect *process*.  It's about finding ways to improve software outcomes in small steps, and on a rolling basis.  The *sprint* (usually about 2-3 weeks in length) becomes the team's official unit of time.  The team is expected to deliver improved software with each tick of the clock.

Agile teams have a menu of choices when it comes to sprint activities.  In addition to coding, teams can incorporate daily stand-ups, estimation meetings, prioritization, release planning, and team retrospectives.  These activites are supposed to be the structural beams that undergird the team's communication and process flow.

If you're new to the notion of a "retrospective,"  it's simply a designated time at the end of each sprint for the team to take a breather and reflect on the work that's been done. Together, the team discusses ways in which they would like to improve the next sprint.

But I have also found that retrospectives aren't just for teams.  I will begin with a brief summary of my personal spin on the team retrospective format, and then describe how I've successfully adapted it for improving student outcomes in classrooms, and for personal career growth.


### For Agile Development Teams

Retrospectives are strange things.  They can be more of an art than a science.  Some teams do retrospectives religiously, but for whatever reason, fail to improve from one sprint to the next.  Others might begin a project with enthusiasm for retrospectives, but give them up soon after.  In the hustle and bustle of a software project, where team members are already loaded to the max with a thousand chores and responsibilities, retrospectives can lose out to other, seemingly higher priority activities.

And that's a shame. I believe dropping the retrospective is actually second-worst thing an agile team can do (the first would be dropping the daily stand).  If agile is all about continuous improvement, removing the team retrospective almost guarantees the team won't improve at all.  The value gained from a 30-minute conversation once or twice a month far outweighs the perceived cost in time.

Teams that don't do retrospectives have lost sight of their value.  Rather than using retros as a safe place for the team to come together and come up with honest solutions to real problems, they can slip into a blame game.  Retrospectives should be enjoyable and insightful. A time for the team to kick back and reflect, be transparent, and make observations.

So let's get back to basics and common-sense empiricism. If you've had bad luck running retrospectives on your team, or never tried them before, here's a technique that I think will get you off to a good start: the four-quadrant poster.  Here's what it looks like:

![Team Board](https://raw.github.com/JeffCohen/retro-article/master/team-board.png)

It's a simple process.  Start with food.  Everybody likes food.  Then, get this poster up on a wall or projected onto the screen.  Everybody takes turns shouting out one-sentence retrospective items that fall into one of these four categories.

* **Start**: Something that you think the team should start doing.
* **Stop**: Something that you think the team should stop doing.
* **Continue**: Something that you think the team should keep doing.
* **Aha**: An insight gained from the previous sprint, no matter how small or how large.

The idea isn't to come up with as many items as possible.  That tends to result in people reaching for things to say that aren't very imporant.  I have found that most of the time, there will be one or two items from each category that provide real eye-opening value.  Time-box your retrospective sessions to 30 or 60 minutes.  Don't let the retrospective devolve into a long problem-solving session.  If there's an item that seems to warrant its own discussion, ask the team if it's worth a separate meeting for that item.  Usually, the threat of another meeting motivates the team to find common ground quickly.

Keep your quadrant posters in a place that's always visible, as a constant reminder of the ways in which team agreed to improve.  Remember that thing about not letting history repeat itself?  That will happen if people forget what was agreed upon in the retro.  Your team will find it encouraging as they witness the evolution of the retrospective quadrants from one sprint to the next.

### For Career Growth

The value of the retrospective can be so powerful that it's worth exploring how it can go beyond the classical agile team setting.  I'd like to spend the rest of our time describing two ways in which I have extrapolated it into two other meaningful scenerios: for personal career growth, and in the classroom.

Do you feel like your career isn't headed in the direction you would like?  Perhaps you're think you're headed down the right road, but you wish you could press the accelerator a bit harder?

One of the easiest things you can do to change either your direction or speed is to do a simple career retrospective.  I do this for myself once a year, at the same time every year. I do it whether I'm thrilled with my job or not.  You might find that every six months is a better cadence, but every month is probably too much.  Steering a career can be a bit like steering an aircraft carrier.  You can't always expect to do a U-turn on a dime.  Think ahead, and begin your course corrections early.  Even a small turn in direction will, over time, result in a large difference in your ultimate destination.

My goal is to try to sum up my current level of satisfaction in a way that can both bring meaningful change, but also remind me of the good things that I might be taking for granted.  Without reflection, it's easy for me to take what I have for granted.

So every time I do a personal retrospective, I consider these things about my current job:

* Inputs: Am I being required to use my full brain in a challenging fashion? Or am I just doing the same things over and over?  Am I working with colleagues that I can learn from?
* Outputs: Am I getting the results I want?  Do I like explaining the effects of my job to my friends and family?  Am I helping others?  Am I gradually becoming an authority in at least one area?  Does my compensation reflect the value I bring to the company?

I find it helpful to graph my feelings, and compare graphs from one year to the next.  Here are some example data points I use, graphed on a rough scale of 1-10 for each:

* Mission: to what extent are you excited about the company mission?
* My Role: to what extent do I like my role withing the organization?
* Compensation: is my compensation at a fair amount?
* Physical environment: is the workplace conducive to work?  Do I enjoy coming into the office?
* Culture: do I feel the culture around me is healthy?  Are risks encouraged?  Are individuals wrongly blamed when something goes wrong?  Is there too much politics instead of honest communication?  Are people enjoying themselves and their coworkers?

Plot each of these and connect the dots into a rough curve.  You're not going for detailed accuracy, just an general description.  I think you'll find it a great way to describe how you feel about your current situation.

But perhaps best of all, your retro curve will act as a spotlight, shining light directly on the areas you can choose to focus on for positive change.  Ask yourself what it would mean to move every data point up to a 10.  Showing your retrospective graph to your boss can be a great way to get an open dialogue started.


### In Educational Settings


Finally I'd like to describe how to use a retrospective in a classroom setting.  As Chief Instructor of The Starter League in Chicago, I've taught about 20 distinct sections of our beginner-focused Web Development course for non-programmers.  At the beginning, I knew I wanted to incorporate the concept of retrospectives into the classroom, but I wasn't sure how.  I tried many different formats and experiments, converging on a simple technique that I think every teacher, regardless of subject area, can put into practice.  I call it the Aha/Fuzzy board, and it looks like this:

![Aha Board](https://raw.github.com/JeffCohen/retro-article/master/classroom-board.png)

Here's the process I use.  At the end of each week, I put up the Aha/Fuzzy Board, and for ten minutes students shout items that should go on the board.  An "Aha!" is one thing that a student learned that week.  One light-bulb.  A moment of clarity, no matter how small.  In my class, it might be "I know how to put a border around an image!" or "I finally understood how to use the .each method" or "A hyperlink isn't a magical thing to me anymore."  I encourage students to jot these aha moments down throughout the week so they can be ready for our Friday sessions.

A "Fuzzy" item is anything we've covered that's still, well, fuzzy.  Examples are "I still don't get what a class method is" or "CSS floats never work right for me."

After ten short minutes, the two columns are full, and we have a goldmine of information.  Actually we have *two* goldmines: one for the students, and one for me!

For the students, the mere act of identifying ahas and fuzzies forces them to reflect on their learning.  It's very easy for students to take for granted what they've learned and be discouraged by the most recent challenge. It's empowering when we can call them out by name.

Sometimes when we start the retro process, there's silence.  No one can think of any Aha moments.  Then, finally, one student will break the ice, mentioning one thing they've learned that week, no matter how tiny.  Then, another student chimes in.  Pretty soon it's an avalanche.  Hearing their peers identify the things they've learned is so helpful to all the other students.  It jogs their memory, and reminds them that even though they might presently be stuck on a problem, they shouldn't forget all the great things they've accomplished so far.  And when they identify Fuzzy items, they've instantly put their finger on what they should be learning next.  Students struggle when they're not sure where they stand.  They can be unsure of where to spend their time.  With the Aha/Fuzzy board, it's becomes immediately clear what they need to go back and study, and what they don't.

As the instructor, the Aha/Fuzzy board provides fantastic feedback on how I'm doing as a teacher.  I can quickly find out which of my lessons took root, and which did not.  Aha moments point to lessons that were crafted well; fuzzies tell me which topics I might want to spiral on again next week.  The board gives me food for thought on how to plan the next week.

### Moving Forward

For me, taking time to reflect has been vital.  It's been like getting Lasik for my teams, my career, and my classroom.

But these three retrospective boards are just the ones that I use.  I'd love to hear how you use retrospectives and how you go about them.  Find me on twitter, @jeffcohen, or email me anytime at jeff@starterleague.com.
